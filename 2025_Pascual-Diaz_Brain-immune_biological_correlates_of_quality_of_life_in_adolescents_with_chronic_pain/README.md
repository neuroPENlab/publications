## 📄 Overview

This project investigates how brain responses to non-painful multisensory stimulation and immune-inflammatory markers—specifically neutrophil-derived measures—relate to physical and psychosocial quality of life (QoL) in adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain.

We provide the full set of scripts for:
- Multisensory fMRI task preprocessing and analysis (CONN toolbox)
- Seed-based functional connectivity analyses
- ComBat harmonization of fMRI data across scanners
- Statistical models relating brain function and QoL
- Mediation analyses linking immune markers, brain function, and QoL
